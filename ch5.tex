\chapter{Summary and Conclusion}

Material structure of thin films using three different successive ionic layer adhesiona nd reaction processes were compared.
It was found out that the particle distribution among the three processes are random and do not exhibit significant differences.
From here, no relationships can be made between material structure and material property using the proposed model.
The project was unsuccessful in comparing the structural and property differences, most notable the two-point spatial correlations, of the differentially fabricated thin films.

\chapter{Recommendations}

It is recommended to perform different fabrication methods by incorporating a drying process as discussed in Chapter 4 and to further develop the MKS framework in the Julia language.
The code used for the implementation is available on Github: bldamalla/research-3-adhesion.
